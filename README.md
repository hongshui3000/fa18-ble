[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucberkeley-ee290c/fa18-ble.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ucberkeley-ee290c/fa18-ble)

This Documentation is for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Baseband group work in EE290C @ UC Berkeley 2018 fall semester.
<br><br><br>
### Overview
-Update to new Chisel standard and connect to new RocketChip 

-Build the Chain of PacketAssembler and insert FIFOs for testing

-Construct C tests to verify the functionality
<br><br><br>

### Working Principle
1. We updated the BLE baseband accommodated to the new Chisel standard (eg. LazyModule)

### Acknowledgement
Here is our appreciation to Prof. Borivoje Nikolic, Prof. Kristofer Pister and the GSI Paul Rigge for guiding us in this project. Their valuable suggestions and feedback help us move forward. Also the work from last semester's group inspired us greatly and here is their tape-out (https://github.com/tapeout/ble-baseband). Lastly, we would like to thank David Burnett and Rachel Zoll for helping us get on board and explain the former BLE stucture and tests.
